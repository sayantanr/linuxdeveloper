copy the script in /etc/resolv.conf  being the super user.
first run the command  sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf  and note your router gateway
*** please note that you will lost your pasted commands in /etc/resolv.conf  after every restart . so make  a file like dns.txt by using command 
sudo nano dns.txt paste the script and save it ... 
thats all
in my case my  tplink  router gateway is noted as

nameserver 192.168.0.1

*********************************************after every restart u will lose info stored in /etc/resolv.conf so make a file dns.txt for backup and paste it
please note u r router gate way and write it like in /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver u r router gateway (in my case it is 192.168.0.1)
***please note that if there is no entry in /etc/resolv.conf u will lose ur connection so search for router gateway and at least paste it
***note that using dns script decreases website loading time so u can enjoy youtube without any lagging even u can see 4k or 8k videos without any lagging but it never increases downloading time ... use xdm uget for it .. if there is any delay playing 8k caused by ur net connection or processor graphics ... so enjoy... it will increase ur surfing speed by 20 to 40 times....
