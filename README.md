copy the script in /etc/resolv.conf  being the super user.
first run the command  sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf  and note your router gateway
*** please note that you will lost your pasted commands in /etc/resolv.conf  after every restart . so make  a file like dns.txt by using command 
sudo nano dns.txt paste the script and save it ... 
thats all
in my case my  tplink  router gateway is noted as

nameserver 192.168.0.1
